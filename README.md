# 1. Getting started with Resco CRM Sync
Resco CRM Sync is a tool that allows connecting two organizations. By creating a connection, you can synchronize data and metadata between them.<br/><br/>

The position of the organization can be as:<br/>
a) `Server`: The organization from which you create a client. Updates of metadata (on demand) and data (periodically) are sent to the client.<br/>
b) `Client`: Updates of data are instantly or periodically sent to the server. Updates of metadata can be pulled from server on demand.<br/>
